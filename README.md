# Uncommon Error Handling in Python

This repository demonstrates how to handle uncommon errors in Python using exception handling. The `bug.py` file contains a function that showcases potential issues, including `TypeError` and `ZeroDivisionError`.  The improved version in `bugSolution.py` provides robust error handling for these uncommon scenarios.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python files.
3. Execute the Python script using a Python interpreter: `python bug.py`
4. Observe the different error messages and how they are handled.
